== Installation ==
1. Either use the built-in Wordpress plugin installer to grab the plugin from the Wordpress plugin repository, or upload the entire contents of the `master-paper-collapse-toggle.zip` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

3. Use the shortcode [mpaper]your content[/mpaper]

4. You better set a title. Use the attribute title=“Your Title”. Like this: [mpaper title=“Your Title”]your content[/mpaper] .

5. The default icon is “fa-bullseye”. But you can use any icon available in Font Awsome. First, select the icon you want to use, visiting Font Awsome Icons Cheatsheet Page. Then, copy the name of the icon (“fa-something”) and use it inside the shortcode, as an attribute. Like this: [mpaper title=“Your Title” icon=“fa-arrows”]your content[/mpaper].

6. If you do not want to use icon on your shortcode, go like this: [mpaper icon=“no”]content[/mpaper].
